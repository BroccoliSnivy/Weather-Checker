# 🌦️ Weather Checker (but not really)

A goofy **Tkinter + ttkbootstrap** application that pretends to check the weather... but doesn't. Instead, it gives you a **trolling response** after a fake loading process. 😆

---

## 🎮 Features
✅ Asks for your location (as if it actually matters)  
✅ Displays a **cyberpunk-style progress bar** with smooth animations  
✅ Shows **random fake status messages** during loading  
✅ Finally, instead of real weather data, it **trolls you with a random goofy message** 😭  
✅ Custom message box with **aesthetic design and a custom icon**
